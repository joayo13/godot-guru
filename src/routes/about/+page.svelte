		<h2>About Us</h2>
		<em
			>"Education is not just about teaching people facts; it's about inspiring them to see the
			possibilities beyond those facts. This is especially true in game development, where
			creativity and innovation are paramount." â€” Shigeru Miyamoto</em
		>
		<h3>Our Mission</h3>
		<p>
			The quote above encapsulates what we aim to do. We aim to inspire our students and teach them
			that learning is not something to be rushed. But a lifelong pursuit that can be enjoyable, and
			bring joy. More than anything, we want to give our students the confidence to step out and
			make mistakes, and empower them with not only the knowledge of how to make games, but why to
			make games.
		</p>
		<h3>Our Approach</h3>
		<p>
			We believe in learning by doing, and by understanding the why before the how. We do this with:
		</p>
		<ul class="">
			<li>interactive lessons</li>
			<li>one-on-one mentoring</li>
			<li>project based learning</li>
			<li>in-depth video tutorials</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			We aim to make our teaching affordable for all. We are always willing to make accommodations
			for those who stuggle financially.
