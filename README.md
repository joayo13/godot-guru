# Godot Guru

[Live Demo Link](https://godotguru.netlify.app/)

**Godot Guru** is a [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) application designed to be the foundation for a educational platform, it features a paid subscription service with Stripe API and a clean modern and responsive design.
I enjoy making games when I'm not doing web dev, so this is the bridge between the two worlds.
